# Digital Maze 3D

Browser-based 3D maze game using Three.js and a seeded maze generator.

## Run
1. Primary (no local server): open `index.html` directly in a modern browser.
2. Fallback: use a local static server only if your browser blocks local file execution.

Note: internet access is still required because Three.js is loaded from CDN.

## Controls
- Move: `WASD` or Arrow keys
- Reset run: `R`
- Generate new seed: `N`
